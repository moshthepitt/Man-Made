A book on manhood

## We are not happy

Who is "we"? Men.  Men, in general, are not happy.  Why, you ask?

First, I'll start with my own story.  For years I was not happy.  I was not happy with myself and my life.  I felt like I was worthless and going nowhere.  I badly wanted a better life, a more purposeful life but I had no idea how to achieve that.  I was not happy with my finances.  I was not happy with the look and feel of my body.  I was not happy with how I spent the majority of the time.  And most depressingly, I was not happy with my relationship with women.  I was miserable.

What if I told you that most men, like me, are similarly not happy?

Are you happy with your life?  Are you happy with your finances, are they in order?  Do you have the kind of relationships with women that you want?  Are you in shape?  Do you live a fun life?  I was miserable for many years because I felt very very dissatisfied with my life.  If you are at a similar place.  I feel for you.  I know what you are going through and that it sucks.

But.  There is hope.

So a while back I stumbled upon a group of men who seemed to have the kind of life that I wanted.  They had good looking bodies, in-shape finances, fun hobbies, dated hotties, and their lives seemed so very purposeful.  And yet their "formula" for success seemed so simple.

This book is my attempt to present this "formula" of success to you.  I must warn you, though, it is nothing fancy or out of the ordinary; it is just all about sheer focused hard work.

### The formula for success in life

- Lift hard
- Eat right
- Groom well, have a good sense of style
- Read non fiction
- Meditate everyday
- Develop a titanium frame
- Have a solid foundation for your finances
- Learn to be social with everyone
- Have fun hobbies that you are passionate about
- Find a purpose in life

That is it!  If you implement all the above in your life then I personally guarantee that you will be much happier with your life than you had been.  Easy, right? :)

In the next 'chapters' of this book, I'll go through them one by one and explain them as I see them, and provide references to other people who explain them much better than me.

Godspeed!
